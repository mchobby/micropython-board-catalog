ESP8266-EVB is board suitable for resarch and development of espressif's ESP8266EX chip. The module be used for home automation, smart plugs and lights, mesh networks, industrial wireless control, baby monitors, IP cameras, sensor networks, wearable wlectronics, etc.
ESP8266EX is very highly integrated SoC which includes Tensilica's L106 32-bit core processor; SRAM; power management unit; RF front end. ESP8266EX has a number of interfaces - I2C, SPI, SDIO and also a number of free GPIO pins. The chip allows the implementation of a WIFI TCP-IP stack with just few extra components beside the ESP8266EX.

This product requires Console debug cable to get programmed.

It also exists a [https://wiki.mchobby.be/index.php?title=ESP8266-DEV French documentation of the usage of this board with MicroPython].
