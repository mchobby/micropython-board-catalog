**M5Stack GRAY Kit** is one of the M5Stack development kit series, which is a upgrade from the Basic kits. In comparison, Gray kit provides an extra IMU sensor, BMM150 + MPU6886. Gray kit is a nice choice for users who just get started or in progress.

With a **6 axis IMU posture sensor**, there are a lot of situations which u can apply this kit to: detecting acceleration, angulation, and trajectory. You can make relative products like sports data collector, 3D remote gesture controller and more base on the above functions.

The GRAY is M5 Core device. Its modular, stackable, scalable, and portable device is powered with an ESP-32 core, which makes it open source, low cost, full-function, and easy for developers to handle new product development on all stages include circuit design, PCB design, software, mold design and production.


If you want to explore the fastest way of IoT prototyping, M5Stack development board is the perfect solution. Not like others, M5Stack development board is highly efficient, covered with industrial grade case and **ESP32-based** development board. It integrates with Wi-Fi & Bluetooth modules and contains a dual-core and 16MB of SPI Flash . Together with 30+ M5Stack stackable modules , 40+ extendable units and different levels of program language, you can create and verify your IoT product in a very short time.


Supportive development platforms and programming languages: Arduino, Blockly language with UIFlow, Micropython.


M5Stack Core is consist with two separable parts. The upside part has all kinds of processors, chips and some other slot components. The bottom part has a lithium battery, M-BUS socket and extendable pins on both sides.
