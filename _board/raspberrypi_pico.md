[Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/#board-specifications) is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board with flexible digital interfaces. 

Designed by Raspberry Pi, RP2040 features a dual-core Arm Cortex-M0+ processor with 264KB internal RAM and support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash. A wide range of flexible I/O options includes I2C, SPI, and — uniquely — Programmable I/O (PIO). These support endless possible applications for this small and affordable package.


**For beginners, for experts:** From controlling appliances to operating a light display, Raspberry Pi Pico puts the technology that underpins countless everyday operations into your hands.


Programmable in C and MicroPython, Pico is adaptable to a vast range of applications and skill levels, and getting started is as easy as dragging and dropping a file.


More experienced users can take advantage of Raspberry Pi Pico’s rich peripheral set, including SPI, I2C, and eight Programmable I/O (PIO) state machines for custom peripheral support.


**Getting started with Pico:** The Raspberry-Pi foundation put created a whole [book to help you get started](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/micropython-pico/) with your new Raspberry Pi Pico. From installing MicroPython to getting to grips with PIO, Get Started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico is your essential guide.


**Documentation for the mass:** Whether you’re taking your first steps with a microcontroller or you want to develop a product using RP2040, The foundation puts together [the guides and tools](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/) you’ll need to get the most out of Raspberry Pi Pico.
