**M5Stack M5Go IoT Kit** is a multi-Unit feast with 6 M5units inside (ENV II, IR, RGB, PIR, ANGLE, HUB) like its namesake, is a starter kit among the M5Stack development kit series. Itâ€™s a modular, stackable, scalable, and portable device which is powered with an ESP-32 core, which makes it open source, low cost, full-function, and easy for developers to handle new product development on all stages including circuit design, PCB design, software, mold design and production. This Basic kit provides a friendly price and full-featured resources which makes it a good starter kit for you to explore IoT.


If you want to explore the fastest way of IoT prototyping, M5Stack development board is the perfect solution. Not like others, M5Stack development board is highly efficient, covered with industrial grade case and **ESP32-based** development board. It integrates with Wi-Fi & Bluetooth modules and contains a dual-core and 16MB of SPI Flash . Together with 30+ M5Stack stackable modules , 40+ extendable units and different levels of program language, you can create and verify your IoT product in a very short time.


Supportive development platforms and programming languages: Arduino, Blockly language with UIFlow, Micropython.
