Cytron Maker Pi RP2040 features the first microcontroller designed by Raspberry Pi - **RP2040**, embedded on a robot controller board. The board also comes with dual channel DC motor driver, 4 servo motor ports and 7 Grove I/O connectors, ready for your next DIY robot / motion control project. Now you can build robot, while trying out the new RP2040 chip.

Designed by Raspberry Pi, RP2040 features a dual-core Arm Cortex-M0+ processor with 264KB internal RAM and support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash. A wide range of flexible I/O options includes I2C, SPI, and — uniquely — Programmable I/O (PIO). These support endless possible applications for this small and affordable package.

The **DC motor driver onboard** is able to control 2x brushed DC motors or 1x bipolar/unipolar stepper motor rated from 3.6V to 6V, providing up to 1A current per channel continuously. The built-in Quick Test buttons and motor output LEDs allow functional test of the motor driver in a quick and convenient way, without the need of writing any code. Vmotor for both DC and servo motors depends on the input voltage supplied to the board.

Maker Pi RP2040 features all the goodness of Cytron's Maker series products. It too has **lots of LEDs** useful for troubleshooting (& visual effects), is able to make quite some noise with the onboard piezo buzzer and comes with push buttons ready to detect your touch.


Programmable in C, MicroPython & CircuitPython, Pico is adaptable to a vast range of applications and skill levels, and getting started is as easy as dragging and dropping a file.


**Getting started with Pico:** The Raspberry-Pi foundation put created a whole [book to help you get started](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/micropython-pico/) with your new Raspberry Pi Pico. From installing MicroPython to getting to grips with PIO, Get Started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico is your essential guide.


**Documentation for the mass:** Whether you’re taking your first steps with a microcontroller or you want to develop a product using RP2040, The foundation puts together [the guides and tools](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/) you’ll need to get the most out of Raspberry Pi Pico.

**Examples scripts** for MicroPython are available on the [https://github.com/CytronTechnologies/MAKER-PI-RP2040/tree/main/Examples/MicroPython MAKER-PI-RP2040 GitHub Repository]
