**TinyPICO** is the world’s smallest, fully-featured ESP32 development board, designed to unlock the power of the ESP32’s dual-core 240MHz and internet connectivity, in a package smaller than your thumb!

Don’t be fooled by its size, TinyPICO is a super versatile proto-typing and development board for MicroPython and C. It is available with a Micro-B and USB-C connector.

We have filled every nook on this board, packing a massive 700mA 3.3V regulator, on-board battery management, an RGB LED, 4MB of extra PSRAM and 14 GPIO... and **still breadboard frendly!**

TinyPICO is tuned for ultra low current use, dropping as low as 20uA when in deepsleep.


TinyPICO hardware and software open source. You can find the design files and our code in the [TinyPICO GitHub](https://github.com/tinypico) repository.


See also the [TinyPico-MicroPython](https://github.com/tinypico/tinypico-micropython) with extra drivers and MicroPython firmware.
